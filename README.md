- Hello person on the internet, Iâ€™m @NovaIsOnMars!
- I enjoy playing video games, making video games, and modding video games (specifically modding Minecraft).
- I started out coding with scratch.mit.edu, but once I grew out of that, my abilities expanded.
- Now, I code mostly in python and c# (with unity). I also know HTML and CSS (which are NOT actually programming languages!!)
- Most of my repositories are private, but will likely be made public to view and download when they are closer to completion.
